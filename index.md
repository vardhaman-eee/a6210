# <a name="description">Objectives</a>

  This course offered as an integrated course having theory and practice that gives hands-on training on MATLAB- Simulink and adequately supported by required hardware. From this course students can understand the principles and applications of control systems in daily life. This course deals with basic concepts of block diagram reduction, time domain analysis, and stability analysis of the system in frequency domain, time domain and state equations. This course also emphasizes the understanding and practical applications of PID controllers in the field of power electronics and power systems.

# Coursework

Inform the instructor any time *prior* to the due date for an assignment that you wish to use a late day; you may then turn in the assignment up to 24
hours late. Multiple late days may be used on the same assignment. There are no partial late days; turning in an assignment 2 hours late or 20 hours late will
both use 1 late day. Note that late days are intended to cover both normal circumstances (you simply want more time to work on the assignment) and exceptional circumstances. The late assignments will receive at most half credit.
